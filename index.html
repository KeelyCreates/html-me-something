    <h3>About this Project</h3>
    <p class="About">
        This website was built as the precurser to a knitting app for a coding project.<br /><br />
        Inspiration came when I was trying to adjust a baby blanket pattern that called for 4 weight but
        I was using 3 weight. I wanted to keep the same size but knew with a thinner yarn, I would need
        to cast on more stitches/loops to accomadate the difference. But by how much?<br /><br />
        With this app a user will need to set the yarn weight a pattern calls for, what yarn weight they
        are using, and the program will calculate the number of stitches they will need to add or subtract
        to keep the same pattern.

    <h3>My Knitting Projects</h3>
    <p class="Projects">
        The first project was a pair of fingerless gloves, <a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/fishtail-wristwarmers">
        Fishtail Wristwarmers</a>, that called for yarn weight fingering (2) and needles sized 2.
        The yarn I choose was <a href="https://www.ravelry.com/yarns/library/loops--threads-woolike">
        Loops & Threads Woolike</a> that has a weight of light fingering, aka lace. While I did not adjust
        the pattern for the first glove, I did make stitch adjustments to the second. However, this began
        my curiosity to determine a set method or resource that would help me adjust patterns based
        on yarn weight and needle size.
        <br /><br />
        The second project that I had to considered how to adjust the pattern to fit the needle size
        was <a href="https://www.yarn.com/products/plymouth-yarn-f013-dreambaby-dk-baby-squares-afghan-free">
            Dream Baby Squares Afghan
        </a>. The original pattern calls for size 7 needles while I used
        size 2 needles in the round. I did not adjust the pattern size however this did begin my
        curiosity on how to calculate adjustments to a pattern based on either neede size or yarn weight.

        <h3>Website Resources:</h3>

    For my project I am using the following websites as resources and mathmatical guides to build
    an app to calculate pattern adjustments based on yarn weight and needle size.
