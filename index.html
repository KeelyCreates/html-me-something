    <h3>About this Project</h3>
    <p class="About">
        This website was built as the precurser to a knitting app for my capstone Java project.<br /><br />
        Inspiration came when I was trying to adjust a baby blanket pattern that called for 4 weight but
        I was using 3 weight. I wanted to keep the same size but knew with a thinner yarn, I would need
        to cast on more stitches/loops to accomadate the difference. But by how much?<br /><br />
        With this app a user will need to set the yarn weight a pattern calls for, what yarn weight they
        are using, and the program will calculate the number of stitches they will need to add or subtract
        to keep the same pattern.
