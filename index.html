    <h3>About this Project</h3>
    <p class="About">
        This website was built as the precurser to a knitting app for my capstone Java project.<br /><br />
        Inspiration came when I was trying to adjust a baby blanket pattern that called for 4 weight but
        I was using 3 weight. I wanted to keep the same size but knew with a thinner yarn, I would need
        to cast on more stitches/loops to accomadate the difference. But by how much?<br /><br />
        With this app a user will need to set the yarn weight a pattern calls for, what yarn weight they
        are using, and the program will calculate the number of stitches they will need to add or subtract
        to keep the same pattern.

        My third project was a pair of fingerless gloves (one glove finished, other still in progress).
